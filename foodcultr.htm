  <p>Renowned worldwide, Assam Tea is loved for its bold flavor, rich color, and strong aroma. The tradition of tea in Assam dates back to the 19th century when the British discovered wild tea plants growing in the region, leading to the world’s first commercial tea plantations. Today, Assam is one of the largest tea-producing regions, and tea remains an integral part of both the state’s culture and its economy.</p>

  <h3>Arts & Handicrafts</h3>
  <p>Assam has a timeless legacy of weaving and craftsmanship, dating back centuries. Known as the land of Muga, Eri, and Pat silk, the state is celebrated for handwoven textiles that are not only beautiful but also deeply symbolic of Assamese identity. Traditional looms in almost every household produce exquisite mekhela chadors and other garments. Alongside weaving, Assam’s crafts—ranging from bamboo and cane work to pottery and jewelry—reflect stories of its rich history and cultural heritage, passed down through generations.</p>
